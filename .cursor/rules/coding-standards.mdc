# Coding Standards

## File Organization

- One class per file, named after the class
- One concept per file, group by purpose
- 200 lines max per file; split by responsibility if exceeded
- Minimal `__init__.py`: only re-export public interface
- Lazy imports for heavy dependencies (import inside functions)

## Error Handling

- No fallback logic: crash on invalid input with `assert`
- No defensive try/except: let errors propagate unless recovery is meaningful
- Validate at entry points, not deep in call stack
- When running into errors, do not creat workarounds and actually tackle the underlying problem

## Comments

- Top docstring only; no inline comments
- Script docstrings must include: brief description, usage, input spec, output spec
- For directories: show tree structure with representative files
- For files (JSON, txt, etc.): show schema or example structure
- Explain non-obvious fields or formats

## Code Style

- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use dataclasses for data structures
- Keep functions pure when possible

## Architecture

- Separate CLI parsing from core logic, and use more CLI to enable flexibility
- Always write a submit.sh file for large cli pipeline. 
- Shared utilities in a dedicated directory, keep files organized in dirs! 

## Naming

- `snake_case`: files, functions, variables
- `PascalCase`: classes
- Descriptive names over abbreviations
